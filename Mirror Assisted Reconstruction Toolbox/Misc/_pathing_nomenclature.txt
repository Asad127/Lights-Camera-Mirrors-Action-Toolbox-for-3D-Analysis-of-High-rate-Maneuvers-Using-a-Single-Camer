Pathing Nomenclature used in this toolbox. Path is a bit ambiguous in terms of
is it a file or a folder, and since this distinction is important in the toolbox,
we use the following naming conventions. Note that (ABC) means ABC is an abbreviation
used in the scripts.

DIRPATH / DIRECTORY (DIR): 
    Absolute path to a directory/folder OR the directory containing a file. 
    E.g., "D:\Stuff\Awesome" is a dirpath referencing a directory. However,
    if file "what.jpg" exists in this directory (i.e., filepath is 
    "D:\Stuff\Awesome\what.jpg"), the same absolute path "D:\Stuff\Awesome" 
    is considered the directory of that file.

FOLDER / DIRNAME:
    Relative path to a directory or folder. E.g., if we are in "D:\Stuff", 
	"Awesome" is a folder or dirname, such that fullfile(pwd, dirname) gets us 
	the absolute dirpath. Note that dir(dirname).folder also returns the absolute
	dirpath, but requires that the folder already exists. On the flip side, an 
	absolute dirpath may be split into its parent and dirname (folder) via 
	[parent, dirname] = fileparts(dirpath)

FILEPATH: 
    Abolute path to a file, including the filename. fileparts(filepath) returns 
	the file's dirpath, the file's basename, and the file's extension separately.
    E.g., "D:\stuff\what.jpg", where file's dirpath is "D:\Stuff", basename is
	"what", and "extension" is ".jpg". dir(filepath).name returns the filename,
	which merges the basename with the extension. dir(filepath).folder returns
	the file's dirpath. However, dir method requires that the files exist.

FILENAME / FILE: 
    Full name of file including extension, no parent directories involved. 
    Generally, defined relative to current working directory such that 
	fullfile(pwd, filename) would give the filepath. May be considered relative 
	equivalent for files. NOT defined for directories. E.g., "what.jpg". 

BASENAME (BASE): 
    Filename excluding extensions. NOT defined for directories. E.g., "what" is 
	the basename of file "what.jpg".

EXTENSION (EXT): 
    File extension. NOT defined for directories. E.g., ".jpg" is the extension 
	of "what.jpg". The extension separator (dot) is included.

PARENT / PARENTS: 
    The complete parent structure of a directory or file exactly one directory 
	level above it. In case of a filepath, this means that the parent is the 
	absolute path up to the directory exactly two file separators behind it. In 
	case of a dirpath, the parent is one filesep behind it. "D:\Stuff\Awesome"
	(dirpath) and "D\Stuff\Awesome\what.jpg" (filepath) would, therefore, have 
	the same parent "D:\Stuff". Recall that "D:\Stuff\Awesome" is considered the 
	directory of file "what.jpg". Similarly, "D:\Stuff\Awesome" and 
	"D:\Stuff\Awesome\Amazing\wow.jpg" would have different parents "D:\Stuff" 
	and "D:\Stuff\Awesome".
