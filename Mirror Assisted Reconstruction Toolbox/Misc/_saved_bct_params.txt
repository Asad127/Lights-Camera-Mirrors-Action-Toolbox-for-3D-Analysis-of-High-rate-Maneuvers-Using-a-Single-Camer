Usually, the unique parameters to each view are the calibration file CF, extrinsics Rc_k 
and Tc_k, the intrinsics KK_k, and distortion coefficients kc. The shared parameters 
include the img reference suffix for extrinsics and the view labels corresponding to the 
fixed numbering convention. The suffix indicates which image it was from the calibration 
set, so for calibration images named as Image1, Image2, ..., the suffixes are 1, 2, and 
so on. The reference should be visible in all views (cam + mirrors). The view indices are 
helpful if you have named view conventions. For example, camera is view 1, mirror on left 
is view 2, and mirror on right is view 3. Then you may have only two views, and if it is 
the camera and right mirror, view_idxs would be [1 3], which produces a different result 
than k = 1 : num_views ([1 2]). Thus, it preserves the identity of the view.

However, both the labeled and non-labeled loop numberings are helpful. DLTdv8a requires a 
DLT coefficients file corresponding exactly to th number of views, where each column 
corresponds to the 11 DLT coefficients for a view. The columns are all consecutive. Thus,
when saving DLT params, we need the non-labeled numbering. In fact, during reconstruction,
we completely disregard the labels and only utilize them in titles and legends as the non-
labeled numbering offers a natural way of creating static-sized arrays and slicing into 
them, whereas labeled numbering would require NaN for non-selected views or dynamic sizing.
