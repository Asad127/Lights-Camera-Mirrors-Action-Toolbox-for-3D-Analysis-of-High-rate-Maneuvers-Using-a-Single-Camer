function [matched_line_nums, matched_lines, projects_file_lines, ...
    project_vars, project_dirs] = project_dirs_match(project_identifier)

% Given a project identifier, this function matches it to an existing
% project path in `project_dirs.m` in the toolbox's source directory and
% returns the corresponding line number(s), line(s), along with the three
% outputs of `project_dirs_read.m`, i.e., the textscan of "project_dirs.m",
% and the split components on each of its lines: project_vars (name of 
% variable containing the absolute path) and project_dirs (absolute path to 
% project directory).
%
% This is helpful for a number of path-related operations. Further, the
% reason for returning the outputs of `project_dirs_read.m` is to ensure
% misinputs don't happen. Also note that line numbers are accepted as
% identifiers and the script checks if the provided line number exceeds the
% total lines in `project_dirs.m`.
%
% This script does not check if the matched directories in `project_dirs.m`
% exist or not. That should be checked immediately after calling this
% script as project_dirs{matched_line_nums}.
%
% TAKES 
% =====
% project_identifier:
%   The line number, project name, or directory path in `project_dirs.m` 
%   that identifies the project directory. May also be a cell array where 
%   all elements represnent either numerics or chars. Note for cell array 
%   inputs, no distinction is required between directories and names as the 
%   implementation checks for both by first treating input as an absolute 
%   path, and only if that fails, as the project name.
%
% RETURNS
% =======
% matched_line_nums (scalar or vector):
%   The line numbers in "project_dirs.m" that match the project identifier.
%   Is 0 if no matches are found.
% matched_lines (cell array):
%   Contents of the matched lines. If input is a single project identifier,
%   then this is a 1x1 cell containing the corresponding line from
%   "project_dirs.m". Otherwise, it's a cell vector containing all lines
%   corresponding to the cell array of project identifiers at input. Is
%   empty if no matches are found.
% projects_file_lines:
%   The lines of the project as a cell vector with each line represented as
%   an element of the cell.
% project_vars:
%   The variables that contain the project directories. Part of the
%   variable name is created with the project's name, which is the last
%   part of the absolute dirpath.
% project_dirs:
%   The absolute paths to the project directories.

% Read all the lines and get the one corresponding to the line number.
[projects_file_lines, project_vars, project_dirs] = project_dirs_read();
num_projects = numel(project_dirs);

% Get line number based on the type of input. If numeric and less than the 
% number of existing projects, set it equal to the target line number.

% If user provides a character vector, it may be either a name or a dir. 
% Compare against each existing project directory line-by-line. If at any 
% given path, the user input is not matched to a directory, try matching it
% using the name as the reference instead before moving to the next path. 
% Grab the line number of the path where it matches.
